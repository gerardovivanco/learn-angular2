With Angular 2, the process of getting up and running has evolved a bit. We now need a build step setup to compile all of our code down to standard ES5 code that browsers can run.

A great resource and playground is [ng2-play](https://github.com/pkozlowski-opensource/ng2-play) by Pawel Kozlowski, an Angular core member. This will give the minimal pieces need to build and compile your code.
