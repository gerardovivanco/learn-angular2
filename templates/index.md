Templates are very similar to templates in Angular 1, though there are many small syntactical changes that make it more clear what is happening.

## A simple template

Let's start with a very simple template that shows our name and our favorite thing:

```html
{% raw %}
<div>
  Hello my name is {{name}} and I like {{thing}} quite a lot.
</div>
{% endraw %}
```

## `{}`: Rendering

To render a value, we can use the standard double-curly syntax:

```html
{% raw %}
My name is {{name}}
{% endraw %}
```

Pipes, previously known as "Filters," transform a value into a new value, like localizing a string or converting a floating point value into a currency representation:

## `[]`: Binding properties

To resolve and bind a variable to a component, use the `[]` syntax. If we have `this.currentVolume` in our component, we will pass this through
to our component and the values will stay in sync:

```html
<video-control [volume]="currentVolume"></video-control>
```

## `()`: Handling events

To listen for an event on a component, we use the `()` syntax

```html
<my-component (click)="onClick($event)"></my-component>
```

## `[()]`: Two-way data binding

To keep a binding up to date given user input and other events, use the `[()]` syntax. Think of it as a combination of handling an event and binding a property:

```html
<input [(ngModel)]="myName">
```

The `this.myName` value of your component will stay in sync with the input value.

## `*`: The asterisk

`*` indicates that this directive treats this component as a template and will not draw it as-is. For example, `ngFor` takes our `<my-component>` and stamps it out for each `item` in `items`,
but it never renders our initial `<my-component>` since it's a template:

```html
<my-component *ngFor="#item of items">
</my-component>
```

Other similar directives that work on templates rather than rendered components are `*ngIf` and `*ngSwitch`.
